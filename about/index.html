            <p>Hi! I'm Brendan Gasparin, a web developer and designer. I grew up in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. It's a beautiful little island full of natural landscapes, unique wildlife, and tight-knit communities of great people. If you've never been here, I highly recommend you visit.</p>
            <p>As a kid, I was the neighbourhood "computer whiz", and I spent a lot of time learning BASIC from the manual that came with my Commodore 64. I would copy video games from magazines, and even programmed my own text-based RPGs.</p>

          <div class="column-half">
            <p>In my teenage years I upgraded to a 386 PC, and later a Pentium with Windows 95. I was into modding early 3D games like Quake, and using Microsoft Word to write content for Dungeons & Dragons games.</p>
            <p>Eventually, in the mid-90s, I got a job writing websites for a local web development agency. This was my introduction to the amazing world of the Internet. I would write copy and HTML for about thirty pages a day, serving clients around Australia, building up my chops in HTML and web design.</p>

          <div class="column-half">
            <p>After leaving this company I went to university to pursue a career in computer science. Here I learned programming languages such as Java, C, C++, and C#, and mobile app development languages. I also learned more advanced web development languages such as JavaScript, PHP, and SQL for database management. I also took courses to study the intersection of business and technology.</p>
            <p>I'm a lifelong learner. After graduating with a Bachelor of Computing I continued to hone my skills in web development and programming, as well as deliving into game creation engines such as Godot, Unity, and the Unreal engine.</p>
            <p>After the pandemic I realised I had the skills necessary to strike out on my own as a freelance web consultant. Now I am here to serve your Internet needs.</p>

          <div class="column-half">
            <p>With over twenty-give years experience in web technologies, I specialise in building fast, secure, and visually stunning websites. I craft responsive designs that look good on all screen sizes. I tailor your content to take full advantage of search engine optimization (SEO). I integrate seamless user experiences, and ensure your website is optimized to load as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>Working closely with my clients, I bring a holistic approach to every project. My expertise spans HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Python, alongside platforms such as WordPress and Webflow. Whatever your desire for your online presence, it is my mission to bring it to life.</p>
            <p>What sets me apart from other web developers is my dedication to understanding your unique vision. I know small business owners juggle countless responsibilities, from professional to personal and family duties. This is why I focus on delivering streamlined, affordable solutions that save you time and money. My approach is personal, collaborative, and backed by a promise of excellent customer service.</p>

          <div class="column-half">
            <p>Outside of coding and design, I'm passionate about learning and creativity. When I'm not building websites I can be found sketching or painting, writing (check out my <a href="./blog/">blog</a>), playing video games and Dungeons & Dragons, or exploring Tasmania's beautiful landscapes with my kids and my BFF, Buddy the dog.</p>
            <p>My favourite shows include Silicon Valley, Mr Robot, and Rick and Morty. I am a fan of pop music, punk rock, and heavy metal. I am an avid reader and writer of fiction, and strive to increase my knowledge through reading and writing of non-fiction as well.</p>
